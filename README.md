# :notebook: Important Notes
### When Creating a new Default learning module, one must follow these steps:
* Create a Blank HTML page without inheriting any base template
* Every input that you wish to save progress for should inherit the "dynamicInput" html class and should have a unique name. For example, the input names in "module1" should use the prefix "m1".
